## What is PyTorch?  
Python-based scientific computing package for two purposes:  
* A replacement for Numpy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators.
* An automatic differentiation library to implement neural networks.  

## Goal of this tutorial:
* Understand PyTorch's Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.
* Train a small neural network to classify images

## Steps:
1. Tensors
2. A gental introduction to `torch.autograd`
3. Neural networks
4. Training a classifier
